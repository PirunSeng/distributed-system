TODO:

WAY 1: Single Server
- Perform word counting on the same pc. No new client, no master server, no slave server. Everything in client-server (1 client, 1 server as sample app we have built.)

Way 2: Distributed Servers
- Extend current client to be master server.
- Create a new client
- Create slave servers

- Client:
	- Read file(done)
	- Send file to master server, log start time(done)
	- Receive respond from server, and log time, and file size, number of servers.(done: 90%, need to save log to file)
- Master Server:
	- Receive file from new client(done)
	- Perform logic to split tasks to new slave/RMI servers.(done)
	- Split file to string by number of slave server. E.g 3 strings for 3 servers.(done: 80, issuse with split logic)
	- Receive response word frequency from slave servers.(done)
	- Merge response to be a new response for sending back to client.(done: 90, race condition when use thread)
- Slave server:
	- Receive request/string from master server.(done)
	- Count word.(done)
	- Send count word to master server back.(done)
